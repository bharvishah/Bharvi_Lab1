# How much money did we make this week?

# Also, bonuses are paid to employees who pilot the Planet Express
# Different employees have favorite destinations they always pilot to
# Fry - pilots to Earth (because he isn't allowed into space)
# Amy - pilots to Mars (so she can visit her family)
# Bender - pilots to Uranus (teeheee...)
# Leela - pilots everywhere else because she is the only responsible one

# How many trips did each employee pilot?
# They get a bonus of 10% of the money for the shipment as the bonus
# How much of a bonus did each employee get?

# BONUS 1
# How much money did we make broken down by planet?
# ie.. how much did we make shipping to Earth? Mars? Saturn? etc.

# BONUS 2 - uses classes for each shipment; but not necessary
